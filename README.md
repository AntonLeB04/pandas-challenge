https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sort_values.html and https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.head.html were both used in order to figure out the Highest and Lowest performing schools by % overall passing

Written Report:
The analysis shows that there is better learning outcomes when students attend a charter school vs a district school. Schools overall struggle to havve students perform as well in math compaired to reading scores. This could be contributed to the fact that the reading would be in the native language of the students and math would be more of a new concept for them. The total amount of money spent per student doesn't appear to be a determining factor on the outcome of overall passing percentage.
